# <README Generator>

## Description

Iâ€™ve created a README.md generator so that users can easily create README.md files.


## Installation

On the index.js page run node index.js and the generator will activate asking questions to fill into the README file. 

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
